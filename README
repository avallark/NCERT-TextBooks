#NCERT Complete Textbook repository

This is an attempt to make available the NCERT textbooks without having to go through the tedious NCERT website.

I have classified this into classes and currently you have books only for 8,9,10,11 & 12. 

One more thing I have done is I have merged all the separate chapter pdfs you get from the NCERT website into a single pdf so that it is easier to download and use.
